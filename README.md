# Audio-Noise-Removal-MATLAB
This project focuses on mitigating the disruptive noise caused by Vuvuzelas, the infamous plastic horns known for their deafening monotone sound. The noise generated by Vuvuzelas poses a significant challenge in various audio applications, particularly in sports broadcasts and public events. This MATLAB-based solution aims to suppress the Vuvuzela noise while preserving the clarity of the original audio signal using a filter design.
